# todo-mvvm-single-live

This version of the app is called todo-mvvm-single-live, and it uses some Architecture Components like ViewModel, LiveData, and other lifecycle-aware classes. It's based on the [todo-mvvm-databinding](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/todo-mvvm-databinding/) sample, which uses the [Data Binding Library](http://developer.android.com/tools/data-binding/guide.html#data_objects) to display data and bind UI elements to actions.

This sample is not final, as the Architecture Components are in alpha stage at the time of writing this document.

## What's different to todo-mvvm-live
This is an adaptation of the [todo-mvvm-live](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/dev-todo-mvvm-live) example, that uses a single view data object to represent and alter the view state, and Kotlin.
